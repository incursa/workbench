# Work

This directory tracks work items end-to-end.

## Layout

- `work/items`: active work items named `<ID>-<slug>.md`.
- `work/done`: closed items for reference and audit history.
- `work/templates`: templates used to create new work items.

## Workflow

1. Start from a template in `work/templates/`.
2. Create a new file in `work/items/` with a clear ID and slug.
3. Move the item to `work/done/` when it is closed or superseded.
