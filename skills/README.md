# Skills

Example Codex skills intended for users of Workbench. Copy these into your own
project if you want Codex to follow Workbench workflows for docs, work items,
and sync.

- `skills/workbench-docs`: create and maintain documentation with Workbench.
- `skills/workbench-architecture`: capture architecture and ADR decisions.
- `skills/workbench-work-items`: manage work items and links.
- `skills/workbench-sync`: sync work items with GitHub issues and branches.
