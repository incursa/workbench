# WI-WB-0015 - expand test gate into authored testing intent

Use one of the approved work-item statuses: `planned`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `complete`, `cancelled`, or `superseded`.

## Summary

Evolve [`quality/testing-intent.yaml`](../../../quality/testing-intent.yaml) from a narrow threshold file
into the authored testing-intent contract for the quality evidence subsystem.

## Requirements Addressed

- [`REQ-QE-0001`](../../requirements/QA/SPEC-QA-QUALITY-EVIDENCE.md)
- [`REQ-QE-0002`](../../requirements/QA/SPEC-QA-QUALITY-EVIDENCE.md)
- [`REQ-QE-0003`](../../requirements/QA/SPEC-QA-QUALITY-EVIDENCE.md)
- [`REQ-QE-0004`](../../requirements/QA/SPEC-QA-QUALITY-EVIDENCE.md)
- [`REQ-QE-0005`](../../requirements/QA/SPEC-QA-QUALITY-EVIDENCE.md)
- [`REQ-QE-0006`](../../requirements/QA/SPEC-QA-QUALITY-EVIDENCE.md)

## Design Inputs

- [`ARC-WB-0005`](../../architecture/WB/ARC-WB-0005-quality-evidence-operating-model.md)

## Planned Changes

- The contract captures expected evidence kinds, confidence target, critical
- files, required tests, and intentional gaps.
- V1 remains compatible with the existing gate-style coverage fields.
- The authored contract shape is documented clearly enough that humans and AI
- agents can distinguish it from generated observed evidence.

## Out of Scope

- Unrelated feature work.
- Changes to the linked requirement text.

## Verification Plan

State how the work will be proven and link the verification artifact.

## Completion Notes

Optional implementation notes, deviations, or follow-up items.
