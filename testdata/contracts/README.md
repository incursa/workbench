# Contract Fixtures

Static fixtures used by spec/contract-focused tests.

- `work-item.valid.md`: canonical work item shape expected by parser/validator.
- `work-item.invalid-missing-id.md`: invalid shape used for negative tests.
- `doctor-non-git-error.json`: canonical JSON error envelope shape for repo detection failures.
