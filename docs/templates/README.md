# Document Templates

Reusable templates for common documentation types. Copy these into the
appropriate `docs/` subfolder and adapt them for the specific change.

## Available templates
- `feature-spec.md`: feature requirements and user-facing behavior.
- `adr.md`: architecture decision records.
- `runbook.md`: operational procedures and troubleshooting steps.
- `contract.md`: API, schema, or interface contracts.

## Usage

- Copy the template into the right numbered folder.
- Replace metadata (`owner`, `status`, `updated`) before publishing.
- Keep the structure intact so the doc schema stays valid.
