# TASK-0011 - Add getting started tutorial and sample repo

## Summary

Provide a step-by-step onboarding tutorial plus a small sample repository that
shows Workbench in action end-to-end.

## Acceptance criteria

- A “Getting started” doc walks through install, init/scaffold, create a work
  item, and validate the repo.
- A sample repo (or scripted walkthrough in `examples/`) demonstrates the
  workflow with real work items and docs.
- README references the tutorial and sample so new users can find it quickly.
