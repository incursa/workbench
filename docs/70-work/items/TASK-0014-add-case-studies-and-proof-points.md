# TASK-0014 - Add case studies and proof points

## Summary

Add credible, concrete examples that show why Workbench improves clarity and
throughput compared to ad-hoc workflows.

## Acceptance criteria

- At least 2 “before/after” snapshots showing how work is captured with and
  without Workbench.
- One end-to-end narrative that traces a work item from creation to PR.
- Documented outcomes or metrics (even qualitative) that reinforce the value.
