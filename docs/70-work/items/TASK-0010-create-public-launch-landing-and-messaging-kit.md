# TASK-0010 - Create public launch landing and messaging kit

## Summary

Create a public-facing landing narrative (copy + structure) that clearly
communicates Workbench’s value, differentiators, and call to action for new
users.

## Acceptance criteria

- Landing page outline includes headline, subheadline, value bullets, feature
  highlights, and clear “Get started” CTA.
- Messaging kit captures the top 3 positioning statements and 5 short
  feature/value soundbites for reuse in docs and release notes.
- Content references the CLI install and first-run experience.
